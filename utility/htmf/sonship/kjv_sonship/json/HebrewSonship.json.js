    "1Sa 2:29": "Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons H1121 above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?",
    "1Sa 2:34": "And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, H1121 on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.",
    "1Sa 3:6": "And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I called not, my son; H1121 lie down again.",
    "1Sa 3:13": "For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons H1121 made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.",
    "1Sa 3:16": "Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. H1121 And he answered, Here am I.",
    "1Sa 4:4": "So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons H1121 of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.",
    "1Sa 4:11": "And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons H1121 of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.",

    "1Sa 4:17": "And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons H1121 also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.",
    "1Sa 4:20": "And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. H1121 But she answered not, neither did she regard it.",

    "1Sa 7:4": "Then the children H1121 of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.",
    "1Sa 7:6": "And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children H1121 of Israel in Mizpeh.",
    "1Sa 7:7": "And when the Philistines heard that the children H1121 of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children H1121 of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.",
    "1Sa 7:8": "And the children H1121 of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.",
    "1Sa 8:1": "And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons H1121 judges over Israel.",
    "1Sa 8:2": "Now the name of his firstborn H1121 was Joel; and the name of his second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.",
    "1Sa 8:3": "And his sons H1121 walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.",
    "1Sa 8:5": "And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons H1121 walk not in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.",
    "1Sa 8:11": "And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, H1121 and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots.",
    "1Sa 9:1": "Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son H1121 of Abiel, the son H1121 of Zeror, the son H1121 of Bechorath, the son H1121 of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.",
    "1Sa 9:2": "And he had a son, H1121 whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children H1121 of Israel a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.",
    "1Sa 9:3": "And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, H1121 Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.",
    "1Sa 10:2": "When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son? H1121",
    "1Sa 10:11": "And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the son H1121 of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?",
    "1Sa 10:18": "And said unto the children H1121 of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:",
    "1Sa 10:21": "When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son H1121 of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.",
    "1Sa 10:27": "But the children H1121 of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.",
    "1Sa 11:8": "And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children H1121 of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.",
    "1Sa 12:2": "And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and grayheaded; and, behold, my sons H1121 are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day.",
    "1Sa 12:12": "And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children H1121 of Ammon came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.",
    "1Sa 13:1": "Saul reigned one year; H1121 and when he had reigned two years over Israel,",
    "1Sa 13:16": "And Saul, and Jonathan his son, H1121 and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.",
    "1Sa 13:22": "So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son H1121 was there found.",
    "1Sa 14:1": "Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son H1121 of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side. But he told not his father.",
    "1Sa 14:3": "And Ahiah, the son H1121 of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son H1121 of Phinehas, the son H1121 of Eli, the LORD'S priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.",
    "1Sa 14:18": "And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the children H1121 of Israel.",
    "1Sa 14:32": "And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen, and calves, H1121 and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them with the blood.",
    "1Sa 14:39": "For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, H1121 he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.",
    "1Sa 14:40": "Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son H1121 will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.",
    "1Sa 14:42": "And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. H1121 And Jonathan was taken.",
    "1Sa 14:47": "So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children H1121 of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.",
    "1Sa 14:49": "Now the sons H1121 of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:",
    "1Sa 14:50": "And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son H1121 of Ner, Saul's uncle.",
    "1Sa 14:51": "And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son H1121 of Abiel.",
    "1Sa 14:52": "And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, H1121 he took him unto him.",
    "1Sa 15:6": "And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children H1121 of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.",
    "1Sa 16:1": "And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons. H1121",
    "1Sa 16:5": "And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, H1121 and called them to the sacrifice.",
    "1Sa 16:10": "Again, Jesse made seven of his sons H1121 to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.",
    "1Sa 16:18": "Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have seen a son H1121 of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.",
    "1Sa 16:19": "Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David thy son, H1121 which is with the sheep.",
    "1Sa 16:20": "And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son H1121 unto Saul.",
    "1Sa 17:12": "Now David was the son H1121 of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: H1121 and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.",
    "1Sa 17:13": "And the three eldest sons H1121 of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons H1121 that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.",
    "1Sa 17:17": "And Jesse said unto David his son, H1121 Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp to thy brethren;",
    "1Sa 17:53": "And the children H1121 of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.",
    "1Sa 17:55": "And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son H1121 is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I cannot tell.",
    "1Sa 17:56": "And the king said, Enquire thou whose son H1121 the stripling is.",
    "1Sa 17:58": "And Saul said to him, Whose son H1121 art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son H1121 of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.",
    "1Sa 18:17": "And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant H1121 for me, and fight the LORD'S battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.",
    "1Sa 19:1": "And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, H1121 and to all his servants, that they should kill David.",
    "1Sa 19:2": "But Jonathan Saul's son H1121 delighted much in David: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:",
    "1Sa 20:27": "And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, H1121 Wherefore cometh not the son H1121 of Jesse to meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?",
    "1Sa 20:30": "Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son H1121 of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son H1121 of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?",
    "1Sa 20:31": "For as long as the son H1121 of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die. H1121",
    "1Sa 22:7": "Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear now, ye Benjamites; will the son H1121 of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds;",
    "1Sa 22:8": "That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son H1121 hath made a league with the son H1121 of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son H1121 hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?",
    "1Sa 22:9": "Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son H1121 of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son H1121 of Ahitub.",
    "1Sa 22:11": "Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son H1121 of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.",
    "1Sa 22:12": "And Saul said, Hear now, thou son H1121 of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.",
    "1Sa 22:13": "And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son H1121 of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?",
    "1Sa 22:20": "And one of the sons H1121 of Ahimelech the son H1121 of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.",
    "1Sa 23:6": "And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son H1121 of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.",
    "1Sa 23:16": "And Jonathan Saul's son H1121 arose, and went to David into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.",
    "1Sa 24:16": "And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son H1121 David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.",
    "1Sa 25:8": "Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son H1121 David.",
    "1Sa 25:10": "And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son H1121 of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.",
    "1Sa 25:17": "Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son H1121 of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.",
    "1Sa 25:44": "But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son H1121 of Laish, which was of Gallim.",
    "1Sa 26:5": "And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son H1121 of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.",
    "1Sa 26:6": "Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son H1121 of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.",
    "1Sa 26:14": "And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son H1121 of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?",
    "1Sa 26:16": "This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy H1121 to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD'S anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.",
    "1Sa 26:17": "And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son H1121 David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.",
    "1Sa 26:19": "Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children H1121 of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.",
    "1Sa 26:21": "Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son H1121 David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.",
    "1Sa 26:25": "Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son H1121 David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.",
    "1Sa 27:2": "And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son H1121 of Maoch, king of Gath.",
    "1Sa 28:19": "Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons H1121 be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.",
    "1Sa 30:3": "So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, H1121 and their daughters, were taken captives.",
    "1Sa 30:6": "And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons H1121 and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.",
    "1Sa 30:7": "And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, H1121 I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.",
    "1Sa 30:19": "And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons H1121 nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.",
    "1Sa 30:22": "Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, H1121 that they may lead them away, and depart.",
    "1Sa 31:2": "And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons; H1121 and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul's sons. H1121",
    "1Sa 31:6": "So Saul died, and his three sons, H1121 and his armourbearer, and all his men, that same day together.",
    "1Sa 31:7": "And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons H1121 were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.",
    "1Sa 31:8": "And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons H1121 fallen in mount Gilboa.",
    "1Sa 31:12": "All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons H1121 from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.",
    "2Sa 1:4": "And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son H1121 are dead also.",
    "2Sa 1:5": "And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son H1121 be dead?",
    "2Sa 1:12": "And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, H1121 and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.",
    "2Sa 1:13": "And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son H1121 of a stranger, an Amalekite.",
    "2Sa 1:17": "And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son: H1121",
    "2Sa 1:18": "(Also he bade them teach the children H1121 of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)",
    "2Sa 2:7": "Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: H1121 for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.",
    "2Sa 2:8": "But Abner the son H1121 of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son H1121 of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;",
    "2Sa 2:10": "Ishbosheth Saul's son H1121 was forty years old H1121 when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.",
    "2Sa 2:12": "And Abner the son H1121 of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son H1121 of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.",
    "2Sa 2:13": "And Joab the son H1121 of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.",
    "2Sa 2:15": "Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son H1121 of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.",

    "2Sa 16:9": "Then said Abishai the son H1121 of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.",
    "2Sa 16:10": "And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons H1121 of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?",
    "2Sa 16:11": "And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, H1121 which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.",
    "2Sa 16:19": "And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? H1121 as I have served in thy father's presence, so will I be in thy presence.",
    "2Sa 17:10": "And he also that is valiant, H1121 whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant men. H1121",
    "2Sa 17:25": "And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, H1121 whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.",
    "2Sa 17:27": "And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the son H1121 of Nahash of Rabbah of the children H1121 of Ammon, and Machir the son H1121 of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim,",
    "2Sa 18:2": "And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son H1121 of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.",
    "2Sa 18:12": "And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the king's son: H1121 for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom.",
    "2Sa 18:18": "Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son H1121 to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's place.",
    "2Sa 18:19": "Then said Ahimaaz the son H1121 of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.",
    "2Sa 18:20": "And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son H1121 is dead.",
    "2Sa 18:22": "Then said Ahimaaz the son H1121 of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, H1121 seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?",
    "2Sa 18:27": "And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son H1121 of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.",
    "2Sa 18:33": "And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son H1121 Absalom, my son, H1121 my son H1121 Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, H1121 my son! H1121",

    "2Sa 19:21": "But Abishai the son H1121 of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD'S anointed?",
    "2Sa 19:22": "And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons H1121 of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?",
    "2Sa 19:24": "And Mephibosheth the son H1121 of Saul came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.",
    "2Sa 19:32": "Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: H1121 and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.",
    "2Sa 19:35": "I am this day fourscore years old: H1121 and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king?",
    "2Sa 20:1": "And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son H1121 of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son H1121 of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.",
    "2Sa 20:2": "So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed Sheba the son H1121 of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.",
    "2Sa 20:6": "And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son H1121 of Bichri do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities, and escape us.",
    "2Sa 20:7": "And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son H1121 of Bichri.",
    "2Sa 20:10": "But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son H1121 of Bichri.",
    "2Sa 20:13": "When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son H1121 of Bichri.",
    "2Sa 20:21": "The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son H1121 of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.",
    "2Sa 20:22": "Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son H1121 of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.",
    "2Sa 20:23": "Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son H1121 of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:",
    "2Sa 20:24": "And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son H1121 of Ahilud was recorder:",
